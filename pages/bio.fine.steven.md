Dr. Steven Fine serves as the Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator (PDAA) of the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Environmental Information and as EPA’s Deputy Chief Information Officer (CIO). He also currently serves as the Acting CIO of the EPA. Steve joined the EPA from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), where he served in NOAA Research as Deputy Assistant Administrator (DAA) for Laboratories and Cooperative Institutes since 2013. As DAA, Steve oversaw laboratories that improve environmental predictions and stewardship through research and development (R&D) related to the oceans, Great Lakes, and the atmosphere. He also twice served as the acting DAA for Programs and Administration in NOAA Research, overseeing climate, ocean, and weather research grant programs, as well as budget, human resources, information technology, and other administrative activities. In addition, Steve led the Executive Oversight Board for NOAA’s RESTORE Science Program, which supports long-term sustainability of the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem.

Beginning in 2007, Steve served as Director of NOAA’s Air Resources Laboratory, which conducts R&D in the areas of atmospheric dispersion, air quality, climate, and the atmospheric boundary layer. In that role he led NOAA’s atmospheric transport and dispersion activities in response to the release of radionuclides from the Fukushima Daichi Nuclear Power Plant.

Other accomplishments include developing software to support environmental modeling and dissemination of air quality predictions and observations. He also conducted environmental data mining R&D. Steve has a Ph.D. in meteorology, M.S. in computer science, and B.S. in meteorology and computer science, all from the Pennsylvania State University.
