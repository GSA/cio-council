WASHINGTON, D.C. - On March 29, the Chief Information Officers Council (CIOC), supported by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), hosted a Women in Federal Information Technology and Cybersecurity event at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Jefferson Auditorium.

“Today’s event was an important step in ensuring that we are creating career opportunities in technology for women across the federal government,” said Suzette Kent, U.S. Federal Chief Information Officer, Office of Management and Budget. “Women must play an integral role in both dialogue and idea sharing as we continue to implement solutions to modernize our federal IT systems and counter increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.”

“It was an honor to be part of this incredible event that not only recognized the critical role of women in technology, but also focused on how we can better recruit and inspire more women to seek out career opportunities in federal IT and cybersecurity, ” said Joanne Collins Smee, Deputy Commissioner of GSA’s Federal Acquisition Service and Director of Technology Transformation Services.

Today’s event brought together the nation’s top federal IT leaders, including newly appointed Federal CIO Suzette Kent, and hundreds of federal employees to celebrate the success of women in the federal government. Discussions focused on strategies to engage, inspire and motivate more women to continue to pursue careers in IT and cybersecurity fields.

<strong>About GSA:</strong> The mission of the U.S. General Services Administration is to deliver value and savings in real estate, acquisition, technology, and other mission-support services across Government.
