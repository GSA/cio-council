The integration of mobile technology is underway in Federal IT. While mobile technology and cloud
solutions provide significantly greater flexibility for Federal employees to work remotely, Federal
Agencies must ensure the same level of security is maintained during this transition period to protect
the data on mobile devices.

To address this challenge, the Chief Information Officer (CIO) Councilâ€™s Services, Strategy, and
Infrastructure (SSI) Committee has chosen secure mobility as a priority, and is implementing initiatives
to enhance Federal mobile security.

Last year, the Council hosted a series of Mobile Days, including a Secure Mobility Workshop on October
26, 2017. This workshop featured several agency success stories regarding the implementation of
projects to enhance mobile device security. During the Secure Mobility Workshop, participants
developed recommendations to present to the CIO Council's SSI Committee to identify potential projects
and areas of focus for improving mobile security practices across the Federal Government.
The Council also published a Secure Mobility Toolkit on January 16, 2018. The Federal Secure Mobility
Toolkit leverages success stories of establishing security on mobile platforms to identify best practices
that agencies can use to develop their own mobile security initiatives. The toolkit features 14 program
implementation stories and builds on the Secure Mobility Workshop. These success stories span 10+
agencies and cover topics including Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), Trusted Internet Connections
(TIC), Collaboration Tools, 2-Factor Authentication, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), and Secure
Payments.

The SSI Committee chose stories from the Department of Commerce, Department of Interior, and the
Department of Homeland Security to share on CIO.gov. These stories explore various alternatives to
increase speed, reliability, and availability of information and platforms to be accessed remotely.
As a follow-up to the Secure Mobility Workshop and Secure Mobility Toolkit, the SSI Committee will
develop a new project based on the recommendations provided to the CIO Council.
