This <A HREF="https://gsablogs.gsa.gov/gsablog/2016/08/29/sign-up-for-the-technology-industry-day/">blog</A> entry by the GSA Blog Team was originally published on August 29th, 2016 on the GSA blog.

The General Services Administration (GSA) is known for managing federal real estate and leveraging the governmentâ€™s buying power to get the best deal for taxpayers, but it also drives and leads technology and innovation within the federal government. The Technology Transformation Service (TTS) builds, buys and shares tech to help federal agencies achieve their mission. They create better services for citizens everyday. TTS works closely with the Federal Acquisition Service and the GSA CIO to be first movers in and apply agile technology in a meaningful way.

On September 8, GSA is hosting its very first Technology Industry Day. <A HREF="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/gsa-technology-industry-day-registration-27199447279">Sign up</A> to hear about how GSA is transforming technology in the federal government, see demos of products and solutions developed by technologists and, last but not least, provide feedback on how we can work better with industry. Registration will close on September 6. Below are a few projects we will feature:

<B>Agile BPA</B>
The Agile Blanket Purchase Agreement allows innovation in procurement, lessens the burden on industry and solves problems in a user-centered approach. A great example is the work with the FedRAMP program management office at GSA, the first client to use the Agile BPA. We helped the FedRAMP office hire an agile vendor to implement human-centered design and build a public-facing dashboard about cloud authorizations.

<B>Micropurchasing</B>
Micropurchasing is a process is where the federal government makes small procurements to directly buy products and services, as long as the price does not exceed $3,500. Currently, we are using that process to buy small pieces of open source software and design through the Micro-purchase Marketplace. This process has allowed clients to add valuable features to their products through quick, inexpensive purchases.

<B>Cloud.gov</B>
Cloud.gov is a shared platform built for government that allows agencies to securely deploy systems to the cloud. It takes care of baseline security and scalability concerns and allows federal teams to focus on delivering quality products.
