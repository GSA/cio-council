On Tuesday, July 12th OMB and OPM published the first ever Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Strategy, which is now available on the WhiteHouse.gov. The Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Strategy details a series of near-term actions to identify, expand, recruit, develop, retain, and sustain a capable and competent workforce in key functional areas to address complex and ever-evolving cyber threats.

From the White House blog:

<i>â€”Addressing cyber threats has required a bold reassessment of the way we approach security in the digital age and a significant investment in critical security tools and our cybersecurity workforce.  And these threats demand that we continue to enhance the security of the Federal digital infrastructure and improve the ability to detect and respond to cyber incidents as they occur. That is why, in 2009, President Obama initiated a comprehensive strategy to confront this ever-evolving challenge. The strategy brings all levels of government together with private industry, academia, international partners, and the public, to raise the level of cybersecurity in both the public and private sectors; deter and disrupt adversary activities in cyberspace; improve capabilities for incident response and resilience; and enact legislation to both incentivize and remove legal barriers to cybersecurity threat information-sharing among private entities and between the private sector and the Government.</i>
