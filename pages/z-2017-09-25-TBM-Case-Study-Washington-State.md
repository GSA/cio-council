The Federal government spends at least $90 billion a year on information technology (IT), nearly threequarters of which pays for maintenance of existing systems. Federal agencies, in coordination with the Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), are using the Technology Business Management (TBM) Framework to improve the transparency of their IT spending. The standard TBM taxonomy can help agencies model and improve management of IT costs and services. This case study reviews the largest TBM implementation to date in the public sector, in the State of Washington, to understand the challenges, lessons learned and how greater IT cost transparency is making a positive impact. Implementing TBM is a journey and Washington State still has work to do to fully realize all the benefits of the framework and methodology. However, the stateâ€™s results to date are encouraging and demonstrate the tremendous potential of TBM.
