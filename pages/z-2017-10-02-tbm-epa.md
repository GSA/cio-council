The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) protects human health and the environment by developing and enforcing regulations, giving grants, studying environmental issues and teaching people about environmental issues. EPA has ten regional offices in addition to headquarters located in Washington, D.C.

In late 2016, EPA’s Office of Environmental Information (OEI) began implementing TBM. EPA viewed TBM as a way to demonstrate to executive leadership and component offices how much IT contributes to mission goals. TBM now enables EPA to have conversations with their agency customers about value rather than conversations only on cost. In addition to improving visibility into EPA’s IT dollars, the process of implementation improved data collection and clean-up.
