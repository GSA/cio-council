Today the Federal CIO Councilâ€™s Innovation Committee is releasing the Open Data Prioritization Toolkit. The toolkit assists agencies with evaluating and prioritizing datasets for release. It consists of tools, workbooks, and resources to help agencies evaluate datasets on the criteria of value, cost, and risk. Included in each criteria are questions  agencies can use to aide the data release prioritization process.

In developing the toolkit, the Innovation Committee solicited content contribution from CIOs, CDOs, Open Data teams, and the Open Data Working Group, sharing this toolkit and capturing feedback from over 500 agency employees for comment.  Our initial content collection came from over 20 agencies with over 150 formal comments that were incorporated during the review process.
