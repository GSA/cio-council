This blog entry by the Dan Pomeroy, Director, DCOI Managing Partner PMO, was originally published on October 19th, 2016 on the GSA blog. 

This month over one hundred government data center representatives from around the country participated in the second meeting of the <A HREF="http://go.usa.gov/xkVWq">Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI)</A> Community of Practice (CoP). The CoP is a forum driven by the needs of the agencies and personnel charged with implementing the data center provisions of the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA).

Dale Sartor from the Department of Energy Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL) gave an informative presentation on the resources available through the <A HREF="http://go.usa.gov/xkVDA">Center of Expertise for Energy Efficiency in Data Centers</A>. CoP members can view information about Data Center Energy Practitioner (DCEP) Training, search a repository of resources by technology and type, and access tools to help data center operators and owners identify best practices.

Jim Walker from the NASA Shared Services Center (NSSC) provided an overview of the National Center for Critical Information Processing and Storage (NCCIPS) shared services mission, offerings, and facility.
