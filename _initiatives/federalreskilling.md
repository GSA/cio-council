description: The Federal Cybersecurity Reskilling Academies looks to take two cohorts of 20 to 25 current federal employees from both the information technology occupations and non-information technology occupations and training them to be entry level Incident Response Analysts, Cyber Defense Analysts, Digital Forensic Analysts, or Security Operations Center (SOC) Analysts. These academies are modeled after the highly successful cybersecurity training initiatives launched in the United Kingdom and Australian governments.
