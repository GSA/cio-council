        <h2 class="rs-heading"><span class="rs-1">&gt; </span>The Vision</h2>
        The Federal Cybersecurity Reskilling Academy offers Federal employees the opportunity for hands-on cybersecurity training, one of the fastest growing fields in the country. This reskilling effort is part of the Administration’s commitment to
        developing a Federal workforce of the 21st century, as outlined in the President’s Management Agenda and the recent Government Reform Plan.
        <br><br>
      The inaugural class will be made up of current Federal employees who do not work in the IT field, and will give them the necessary training to work as Cyber Defense Analysts within the government.
        <h2 class="rs-heading"><span class="rs-2">&gt; </span>The Program</h2>
        Once accepted, Academy students will complete a three training course curriculum over three months.
        <br><br>
       The curriculum begins with a cyber essentials course that includes up to 120 hours of modules, labs, and quizzes. This will include an onsite workshop to launch the course for several days followed by a four-week period of follow-on learning, exercise, and exams. Students will then attend a “bootcamp” course live for six full days, followed by two weeks of study and a certification exam.
        <br><br>
       Students who successfully pass the certification exam move on to the final course, which follows a similar timeline.
        <br><br>
       Additionally, Academy participants may complete extracurricular activities and exercises to enhance their learning and skills development, such as online games, cyber competitions, and more. Participants will receive career mentorship and soft skills guidance to help them prepare for re-deploying into the cybersecurity workforce.
