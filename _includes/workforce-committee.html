<p>The Workforce Committee's agenda encompasses the full employment life cycle: workforce planning, recruitment, retention and career development. We work with the HR community to develop, implement and communicate strategies to recruit, retain and manage a fully trained and qualified IT workforce, to meet current and future mission requirements. The Workforce Committee is committed to its strategic goal of providing the Federal Government with a cadre of highly capable IT professionals with mission critical competencies to meet agency goals.</p>
